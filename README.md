## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Open Raycast (default: `Cmd + Space`)
2. Type "Select Appliction" or your custom alias
3. Browse through your applications:
   - **Recent apps** appear first
   - **Running apps** are marked with "Running"
   - **All installed apps** are shown below

### Hotkey Switching

1. **Assign a Hotkey**:
   - Select an app from the list
   - Press `Cmd + H`
   - Enter a hotkey (e.g., `ff` for Firefox, `fi` for Figma)
   - Press Enter

2. **Use Hotkeys**:
   - Open the extension
   - Type your hotkey (e.g., `ff`)
   - App switches instantly!

3. **Remove Hotkeys**:
   - Select an app with a hotkey
   - Press `Cmd + R`

### Search Mode

- Type `Space` followed by search term
- Example: `‚ê£fire` ‚Üí Firefox
- Example: `‚ê£vsc` ‚Üí Visual Studio Code
- Supports abbreviations and partial matches

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Enter` | Switch to selected app |
| `Cmd + H` | Assign hotkey to app |
| `Cmd + R` | Remove hotkey from app |
| Single character | Switch via hotkey (if assigned) |
| `Space + text` | Search apps by `text` term |

## How It Works

### Performance Optimizations

- Uses `lsappinfo` for ultra-fast running app detection (~5ms)
- Caches installed apps for 3 minutes
- 50ms timeout for app scanning to prevent UI blocking

### Intelligent Sorting

Apps are sorted by:
1. **Recently used** - Last 25 apps you switched to
2. **Running status** - Currently running applications
3. **Alphabetically** - All other apps

### Hotkey Conflict Prevention

The extension automatically prevents conflicts:
- E.g. can't assign `ff` if `f` exists
- Bidirectional conflict detection
